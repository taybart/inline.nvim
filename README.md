# Line Notes

**Line_Notes.nvim** is a Neovim plugin to mark specific lines in your code and add notes for future reference. It is meant as a supplement to code comments that you might want to add but don't need or want to be public, or small quick notes to yourself that are tied to a particular line, and are a quicker alternative to Obsidian or Notion or similar.

## Demo

![lineNotes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b361cf26-4d23-4eca-8e10-81a8fcf68954)

## Features

- Add marks with notes to specific lines. Just press enter and you're good to go!
- List all marks and notes using Telescope.
- Navigate to marked lines directly from the list.
- Delete existing notes
- Edit existing notes, just need to close the floating window with the note.

## Installation

Using `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
    "asmorris/line_notes.nvim",
    dependencies = { 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim' },
    config = function()
        local in = require('line_notes')
        in.setup({
            signcolumn = {
                enabled = false,
            },
            virtual_text = {
                note_icon = "üóíÔ∏è",         -- Icon shown in the sign column
            },
        })
        vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>N', function()
            in.notes.show(false) -- don't enter note (i.e. just display in hover)
        end)
    end
}
```

## Default Configuration

The plugin comes with sensible defaults, but you can customize them to your liking. Here's the default configuration:

```lua
require('line_notes').setup({
    -- Customize keymaps
    keymaps = {
        add_note = "<leader>an",    -- Add a new note
        list_notes = "<leader>ln",  -- Open telescope picker with all notes
        delete_note = "<leader>dn", -- Delete note on current line
        show_note = "<leader>sn"    -- Show/edit note on current line
    },
    -- Customize note appearance
    signs = {
        note_icon = "üóíÔ∏è",         -- Icon shown in the sign column
        highlight = "Comment",     -- Highlight group for the icon
        number_highlight = ""      -- Highlight group for line numbers (empty for no highlight)
    }
})
```
